# Mern Starter

This project is a boilerplate setup for a MERN app bootstrapped with create-react-app. It is a full React FE and Express BE utilizing Express, MongoDB, JWT for authentication, and Redux for application state management.

The project uses ESLint and Prettier for consistent formatting. This includes a husky pre-commit to check and fix any code before commiting.

For UI it uses [Fomantic UI](https://fomantic-ui.com/) (a fork from Semantic UI).

The intention of the project is to create a starting off point for creating Progressive Web Apps, without having to setup everything up every time. So this includes a complete login system and development tools to get going straight away.
